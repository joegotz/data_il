# This repository contains data from experiments of Lithium-ion batteries submitted to failures of OD. There are two groups of data:
- 80 experiments have been carried out with a Over-discharging process, where the cell was fully charged and then discharged until 0.1V with a constant load of 1.7 ohm.
- 80 experiments have been carried out with a Over-discharging process, where the cell was fully charged and then discharged until 0.1V with a dynamic load.
