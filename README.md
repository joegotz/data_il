# This repository contains data from experiments of Lithium-ion batteries submitted to failures of OD. There are two groups of data:
- 60 experiments have been carried out with a Over-discharging process, where the cell was fully charged and then discharged until 0.1V with a constant load of 1.7 ohm. The data are in a csv file named static.csv.
- 60 experiments have been carried out with a Over-discharging process, where the cell was fully charged and then discharged until 0.1V with a dynamic load. The data are in a csv file named flexible.csv.

Each csv file contain the following columns:
index: index of the data
v: voltage
t: temperature of the cell
c: current of the cell
cycle : number of the cycle.
